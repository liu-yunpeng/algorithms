# Merge sort - divide and conquer

In any divide and conquer algorithm, though sounds like a 2 step operation, it general involves of 3 major steps:
* Divide
* Conquery
* Merge

Divide, and Conquer are generic and apply to any problem. Merge is often the most challenging part and requires a clever way to combine the two sub-problems in the recursion. Merge is often problem specific. 

## Performance
Merge Sort uses 9 seconds to solve the same problem in the input.txt while a brute-force solution takes 27 minutes on my local setup, 180 times slower.
